There are 3 main pages
- home page (index.html)
- product page (product.html)
- team page (team.html)

The home page and team pages are mostly aethetic and offer little to no functionality. There is a fixed navigation bar at the top of every page in order to allow ease of navigation.

The main functionality lies within the product page. Once on the product page, scrolling down will show all of the available rocks for sale. Clicking on the image of a rock will take you to the details of that product as well as the order form.
